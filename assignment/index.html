          A range of organizations join the World Wide Web Consortium as Members
          to work with us to drive the direction of core web technologies and
          exchange ideas with industry and research leaders. We rotate randomly
          a few of our Member organizations' logos underneath.

          The Web Consortium and its members, with help from the public and the
          web community, focus on a range of business ecosystems that the web
          transforms, including
          <span> E-commerce, Media & Entertainment, Publishing</span>
          and several other areas.
